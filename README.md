# The Annotated IndieWeb Federated Authorization Server

The notebook at https://observablehq.com/@endpointservices/auth is an indieauth/relmeauth authorization server. It implements a generic Oauth 2.0 authorization_endpoint and token_endpoint. By hosting it on Observableh, we hope it becomes trivial to self host.

This Github precense is for reporting issues.
